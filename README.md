# Orion-e
---
A remake of [orion-web](https://github.com/LINKIWI/orion-web) built on top of Traccar (which also support Owntrack clients!), react, material-ui and deck.gl!

### Warning
Currently maps are created via react-arcgis, but in the future will move to react-map-gl, which will require a (free for personal use) mapbox token.

## Stuff that needs to be done

### 1. Move from react-arcgis to react-map-gl
This will not be possible, until react-map-gl@7.x will support deck.gl.
This will allow for a tridimensional map view.

### 2. Export to PDF/Image

### 3. Display Geofencing region

### 4. Use Groups
